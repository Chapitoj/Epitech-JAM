# Epitech-JAM
Parasite game in CSFML for Epitech JAM

Welcome to this adaptation of Bong Joon Ho's awards winning movie.
The goal of the game is simple : kill the 5 members of the family before they call the police. You have a timer on the top left corner of your screen showing how much time you have left, and each time you kill someone, a skull will appear on the top right corner of your screen.

Use the arrows to move up, left, down or right. Press A to kill someone when you are in range (only knife available). Press Z to enable/disable the ATH. Press L to leave the game or ESC to get to the settings.

Have fun !
